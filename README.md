# Program3
This Program03 is a GUI with JavaFX where users can add items to a digital wheel, name the wheel, reverse the wheel, reload the wheel, clear the wheel, report on the wheel, and spin the wheel. Everything works perfectly, just do not spin the wheel if there are no items in the wheel or it will cause the button to display incorrectly.
